# 🧑‍🎓 Jackson - Student Profile Manager

This project is built as part of the **Crio.Do Product Engineer Round 2 Assignment**.  
It demonstrates how to use the **Jackson library in Java** for serializing and deserializing objects, handling JSON field mismatches, and working with real-world use cases.

## 📌 Concepts Demonstrated

- Serialization of Java objects to JSON
- Deserialization of JSON into Java objects
- Using `@JsonProperty` to handle mismatched JSON keys
- Parsing nested structures (e.g., List<String>)
- Real-world theme: **Student Profile Manager**

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

You’ll need:
- Java 8+
- Jackson JAR files:
  - [`jackson-core`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-core/2.15.2/jackson-core-2.15.2.jar)
  - [`jackson-databind`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-databind/2.15.2/jackson-databind-2.15.2.jar)
  - [`jackson-annotations`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-annotations/2.15.2/jackson-annotations-2.15.2.jar)
Place the JARs in the project root or use a `lib/` folder.
